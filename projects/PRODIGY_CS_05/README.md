Task 5: Network Packet Analyzer

This Python program serves as a basic packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. It extracts and displays important details such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and payload data. The tool is intended for educational purposes, with a strong emphasis on ethical usage, and it requires explicit user consent before operation.
Features

    Packet Sniffing: Captures TCP network packets in real-time for analysis.
    Detailed Analysis: Extracts and displays key information from each packet, including:
        Source and Destination IP addresses
        Source and Destination Ports
        Protocol used
        Payload data (limited to the first 50 characters)
    Output Logging: Saves the captured packet details to a text file for future reference.
    Ethical Use Disclaimer: Includes a disclaimer that outlines the ethical use of the tool and requires user consent before operation.

How to Use

    Run the Program: Execute the script to launch the packet sniffer tool.
    Read and Accept Disclaimer: Review the disclaimer carefully and accept the terms and conditions to proceed.
    Capture and Analyze Packets: The program will begin capturing and analyzing TCP packets on the network.
    Review Log: After capturing the specified number of packets, the tool will save the packet details to a text file named packet_sniffer_results.txt for easy review.

This code was developed during my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, showcasing the creation of a basic network packet analyzer for educational purposes. The project emphasizes the importance of ethical use and obtaining user consent before engaging in network analysis
