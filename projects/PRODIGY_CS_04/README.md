Task 4: Simple Keylogger

This Python program implements a basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes. It captures each key pressed by the user and saves the data to a log file, serving as an educational tool to demonstrate how keylogging functions. The program incorporates ethical guidelines and requires explicit user consent before execution.
Features

    Key Logging: Records and logs every keystroke along with a timestamp for precise tracking.
    Log File: Saves the recorded keystrokes to a specified file for later review.
    User Consent: Includes a disclaimer and mandates user acceptance of terms and conditions before proceeding.
    Duration Control: Allows the user to specify how long the keylogger will run, providing control over the logging session's duration.

How to Use

    Run the Program: Execute the script to start the keylogger.
    Read and Accept Disclaimer: Carefully review the disclaimer and accept the terms and conditions to continue.
    Set Duration: Input the duration in seconds for which the keylogger should record keystrokes.
    Logging Keystrokes: During the specified period, the program will capture and log all keystrokes.
    Review Log: Once the duration ends, the log file containing the keystrokes will be saved, and its location will be displayed for your review.

This code was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, serving as a demonstration of building a basic keylogger for educational purposes. The project emphasizes the importance of ethical usage and obtaining user consent before collecting data.
