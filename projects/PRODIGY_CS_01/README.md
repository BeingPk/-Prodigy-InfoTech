Task 1: Caesar Cipher Program

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, enabling users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the characters within the text. The program is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing clear prompts that guide the user through both encryption and decryption processes.
Features

    Encryption & Decryption: The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by applying a specified shift value.
    Customizable Input: Users can input their own messages and choose the desired shift value for the cipher.

How to Use

    Run the Program: Start the script to launch the Caesar Cipher program.
    Choose an Action: Select 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.
    Input the Message: Enter the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
    Specify the Shift: Provide the shift value to apply to the Caesar Cipher.
    View the Output: The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

This code was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, showcasing fundamental encryption and decryption techniques using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
